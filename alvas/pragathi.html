        Alva's Education Foundation (AEF) has more than 25,000 students and 19 institutions under its banner offering undergraduate, 
        graduate and post graduate courses in various disciplines. The Foundation, which takes immense pride in total commitment 
        towards quality and excellence in academic pursuits, is committed to the cause of creating employment opportunities for the 
        rural youth that go unnoticed as they have limited access to employment markets. AEF has also been the chief organizer of 
        successful drives such as Chikkaballapur Udyoga Mela (2011-2013) and the Mangaluru Udyoga Mela 2015 which successfully 
        met HR needs of leading recruiters.
